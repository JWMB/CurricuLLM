# CurricuLLM

A repository with curricular materials, where the initial structure and content is LLM-generated, and over time hopefully improved upon by teachers.

Feel free to fork the repository, and use however you wish (as long as the license is respected).

## Rough plan
* Decide on file structure (maybe [language]/[general area]/[subarea]/[demographic]?)
* Iterate on global prompts so that the initial output is more acceptable
* Add targeted/modified prompts to areas where the global prompts are insufficient
* Better system for illustrations
  * prompt better illustration descriptions and locations
  * Run image generator based on generated descriptions
